# Introduction

This is going to be a full Python to Objective-C Interface Definition Language.

Using the python pyobjc adapter, users will be able to define python-Objective-C bridge classes and auto-generate the corresponding code.

This repo will contain a fully functional introductory example, as well.

## Status

* Very developmental. 
* Right now, rudimentary .py and .h files are being generated.
* A handful of types are supported, more to be added.
* It is unknown if the generated .py and .h files will link against each other. That's the next big step.

## Wish list
* optional arguments
* automatic init functions generated in python and objective-c
* test suite
